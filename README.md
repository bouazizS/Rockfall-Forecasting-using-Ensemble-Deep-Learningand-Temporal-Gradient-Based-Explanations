# Project: Rockfall-Forecasting-using-Ensemble-Deep-Learningand-Temporal-Gradient-Based-Explanations


This repository contains the code for Rockfall-Forecasting-using-Ensemble-Deep-Learningand-Temporal-Gradient-Based-Explanations.

## Data

- **Météo France data**: Available on Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16978847 :
  
  The uploaded CSV files contain meteorological data collected from multiple sensors:
    - 1.0_RR1.csv and 1.0_RR1_2024.csv: These files include precipitation (RR1) data recorded at the LVD station.
    - 1.0_T_St_Hiliaire.csv, 1.0_T_LVD.csv, and 1.0_T_NIVOISE.csv: These files contain temperature (T) data from three different sensors (or "capteurs") located at St Hilaire, LVD, and Nivoise, respectively.

- **Rockfall catalogue**: Real data is restricted. To request access, contact Amitrano David <david.amitrano@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr> and Agnès [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com) 
- **Fictitious catalogue**: A mock dataset is included in `data/fake_catalogue/` for testing the code.
